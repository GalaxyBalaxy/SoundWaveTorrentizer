# The Idea 
## Description:
A script that can analyse the files and generates a media info table and optionally uploads the spectrogram.

It outputs bbcode table into your clipboard for use on various forums.

## Smol bits:
- [x] analyse quality of the album (avg. Bitrate etc.)
- [x] Generate a spectrograph
- [x] upload spectrograph 
- [x] output bbCode
- [ ] add support for Markdown
- [ ] Basic console UI
- [ ] (advanced) generate .torrent 
- [ ] (advanced) upload using UNIT3D api

## Disclaimer:
The code runs and does it is job but it isn't what id call good code, at least rn.
